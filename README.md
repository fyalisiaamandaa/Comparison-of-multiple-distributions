# Comparison of multiple distributions

### Dataset:
- File: `babies.csv`
- Description: The dataset provides mothers and their babies data is a dataset of data related to newborns and individual mothers. It contains 1236 samples and 23 independent variables. The independent variables include infant survival, birth weight, date of birth, sex, motherâ€™s ethnicity, age, education level, height, weight, and smoking status.

### Statistical analysis

It will provide frequency distribution, Assumptions of ANOVA, One-way ANOVA, Pos hoc analysis.

## Frequency distribution

The distribution between each smoking mother category

## Assumptions of ANOVA

- Independence
  The dataset of this project is considered to be independent because it is taken randomly as a sample and each individual is only listed once.
- Normality

  Since the data points are generally distributed along the red line for all groups, we assume normality in this project.

- Equality of variance
